I am a interdisciplinary PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.  

 My PhD research examines the risks, benefits and opportunities associated with the use of off-grid solar PV energy in Rwanda.  Drawing on the [Energy Justice Framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629615300669), I am specifically interested in understanding where risks emerge (distributional injustice), who is ignored or misrecognized in electrification planning and solar PV rollout (recognition injustice) and what processes exist to alleviate and mediate risks (procedural justice). 

 As a mixed methods researcher, I draw on policy analysis, interviews, surveys and mapping for this research. I am also interested in the use of innovative and remote methods to carry out research. 

 Prior to starting my PhD, I undertook a Research Masters (MRes) at the University of St Andrews as part of an ESRC 1+3 studentship. As part of this, I carried out participatory mapping and interviews in Malawi to better understand energy (in)justices associated with off-grid hydroelectricity use (more about output of this work [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620304503)).
